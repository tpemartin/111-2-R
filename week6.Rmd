## Download from dropbox

```{r}

```

-   Original link has `dl=0`. We need `dl=1`

```{r}
courses <- readr::read_csv(dropboxlink)
courses |> 
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

```{r}
week6$data <- courses
```

-   `week6$data` is to retrieve the element with name `data`.

-   however `data` element does not exist.

> How to split a data frame based on a column in R

### ChatGPT

To split a data frame based on a column in R, you can use the `split()` function. Here is an example:

```         
# Create a sample data frame
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"),
  age = c(25, 30, 35, 40, 45),
  gender = c("F", "M", "M", "M", "F")
)

# Split the data frame based on the gender column
gender_split <- split(df, df$gender)

# View the resulting list of data frames
gender_split
```

In this example, we create a data frame `df` with three columns: `name`, `age`, and `gender`. We then use the `split()` function to split the data frame into a list of data frames based on the `gender` column. The resulting list `gender_split` contains two data frames, one for females and one for males.

### in practice

```{r}
courses |> split(courses$學年) -> week6$dataSplit$byYear
```

```{r}
week6$dataSplit$byYear$`107` |> View()
```

```{r}
week6$dataSplit$byYear$`107` |> 
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

## String pattern

## Q1: 每週三有什麼課？

```{r}
targetCourses <- week6$dataSplit$byYear$`107` 
```

> In targetCourses what courses are on Wednesday?

1.  What element value has crucial information to answer that question?

    ```{r}
    dplyr::glimpse(targetCourses)
    View(targetCourses)
    ```

    ```{r}
    my_vector <- c("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "pear", "pineapple")
    filtered_vector <- my_vector[grep("b", my_vector)]
    ```

### Retrive elements by positions or logicals

```{r}
positions <- grep("p", my_vector)
print(positions)
my_vector[positions] # [postion indices]
```

-   [Retrieve multiple elements](https://tpemartin.github.io/NTPU-R-for-Data-Science-EN/element-values.html#retrieve-multiple-element-values)


### Approach 1: grep

```{r}
targetCourses$上課時間教室 #1
 my_vector <- targetCourses$上課時間教室 #2
 positionIndices = grep("每週三", my_vector) # 3
filteredCourses = targetCourses[positionIndices, ] #4

```

### Approach 2: chatGPT subset

> How to filter a data frame based on some criterion in R

In R, you can filter a data frame based on some criterion using the `subset()` or `filter()` functions. Here are some examples:

Using `subset()` function:

```
# create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("John", "Jane", "Bob", "Alice"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 20, 35),
  Gender = c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female")
)

# filter the data frame to only include females
female_df <- subset(df, Gender == "Female")

# display the resulting data frame
female_df
```

Using `filter()` function:

```
# create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("John", "Jane", "Bob", "Alice"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 20, 35),
  Gender = c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female")
)

# filter the data frame to only include people over 25 years old
over_25_df <- filter(df, Age > 25)

# display the resulting data frame
over_25_df
```

Both `subset()` and `filter()` functions take a data frame as the first argument and a logical expression as the second argument. The logical expression is used to select the rows of the data frame that meet the specified criterion.


```{r}
pick <- targetCourses$上課時間教室 == "每週三"
pick |> table()

# pick <- grep("每週三", targetCourses$上課時間教室)
pick <- grepl("每週三", targetCourses$上課時間教室)
pick

filteredCourses <- 
  subset(targetCourses,
         grepl(
           "每週三", targetCourses$上課時間教室))
View(filteredCourses)
```


# Logical expression on characters



```{r}
"每週三2~4" == "每週三"

c("每週三2~4", "每週三") == "每週三"
```

  * `==` totally the same. 
  
```{r}
grep("每週三", c("每週三2~4", "每週三"))
```

  * grep is used to detect **pattern**
  
> How to detect a pattern in a character vector in R?

In R, you can detect a pattern in a character vector using regular expressions. The `grep()` function is commonly used for this purpose. Here's an example:

```
# create a character vector
my_vec <- c("apple", "banana", "grape", "pineapple")

# use grep() to detect the pattern "app" in the vector
grep("app", my_vec)

# output: 1 4

# the output indicates that the pattern "app" is found in the first and fourth elements of the vector (i.e., "apple" and "pineapple")

# you can also use the grepl() function to detect if the pattern is present in a character vector
grepl("app", my_vec)

# output: TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE

# the output indicates that the pattern "app" is present in the first and fourth elements of the vector (as TRUE values)
```

In the `grep()` function, the first argument is the pattern to be detected, and the second argument is the character vector to be searched. The function returns the indices of the elements in the vector that contain the pattern. 

In the `grepl()` function, the first argument is the pattern to be detected, and the second argument is the character vector to be searched. The function returns a logical vector indicating whether the pattern is present in each element of the vector.

### Retrive elements by logicals

```{r}
Name = c("John", "Jane", "Bob", "Alice")
# position indices
Name[c(1,4)]
# logicals
Name[c(T, F, F, T)]
```

### Approach 3: use dplyr

  * only work on data frame object

> How to filter a data frame based on some criterion in R using the package dplyr

In R, you can filter a data frame based on some criterion using the `filter()` function from the `dplyr` package. Here's an example:

```
# load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)

# create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("John", "Jane", "Bob", "Alice"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 20, 35),
  Gender = c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female")
)

# filter the data frame to only include females
female_df <- filter(df, Gender == "Female")

# display the resulting data frame
female_df
```

In the `filter()` function, the first argument is the data frame to be filtered, and the second argument is the filtering criterion. You can use the `==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, and `!=` operators to specify the criterion. You can also combine multiple criteria using the `&` (and) and `|` (or) operators.

For example, to filter the data frame to only include females who are over 25 years old, you can use the following code:

```
# filter the data frame to only include females who are over 25 years old
female_over_25_df <- filter(df, Gender == "Female" & Age > 25)

# display the resulting data frame
female_over_25_df
```

This will return a data frame with only one row, containing the information for Alice.


```{r}
# load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)
# create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("John", "Jane", "Bob", "Alice"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 20, 35),
  Gender = c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female")
)

# filter the data frame to only include females who are over 25 years old
df$Gender == "Female"
df$Age > 25

female_over_25_df <- filter(df, Gender == "Female" & Age > 25)


df |> 
  filter(
    Gender == "Female",
    Age > 25
  )
# display the resulting data frame
female_over_25_df
```

  * `&` link multiple **logical expression** as AND joint criteria.


  * [dplyr website](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
  
    * function's first input is always data frame.
    
    * functions's output is always data frame.
    
```
library(dplyr)

df |> 
  fun1() |>
  fun2() |>
  fun3() 

```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
targetCourses |>
  dplyr::filter(
    grepl("週三",上課時間教室)
  )
```
