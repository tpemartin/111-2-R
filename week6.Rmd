# Project

## Object to save progress

```{r}
# create an empty list
week6 <- list()
```

## Download from dropbox

```{r}
dropboxlink = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/6vhwbxnzc0fz3is/90-107%E5%AD%B8%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%A6%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E9%83%A8%E8%AA%B2%E7%A8%8B%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99.csv?dl=1"
```

-   Original link has `dl=0`. We need `dl=1`

```{r}
courses <- readr::read_csv(dropboxlink)
courses |> 
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

```{r}
week6$data <- courses
```

-   `week6$data` is to retrieve the element with name `data`.

-   however `data` element does not exist.

> How to split a data frame based on a column in R

### ChatGPT

To split a data frame based on a column in R, you can use the `split()` function. Here is an example:

```         
# Create a sample data frame
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"),
  age = c(25, 30, 35, 40, 45),
  gender = c("F", "M", "M", "M", "F")
)

# Split the data frame based on the gender column
gender_split <- split(df, df$gender)

# View the resulting list of data frames
gender_split
```

In this example, we create a data frame `df` with three columns: `name`, `age`, and `gender`. We then use the `split()` function to split the data frame into a list of data frames based on the `gender` column. The resulting list `gender_split` contains two data frames, one for females and one for males.

### in practice

```{r}
courses |> split(courses$學年) -> week6$dataSplit$byYear
```

```{r}
week6$dataSplit$byYear$`107` |> View()
```

```{r}
week6$dataSplit$byYear$`107` |> 
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

## String pattern

## Q1: 每週三有什麼課？

```{r}
targetCourses <- week6$dataSplit$byYear$`107` 
```

> In targetCourses what courses are on Wednesday?

1.  What element value has crucial information to answer that question?

    ```{r}
    dplyr::glimpse(targetCourses)
    View(targetCourses)
    ```

    ```{r}
    my_vector <- c("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "pear", "pineapple")
    filtered_vector <- my_vector[grep("b", my_vector)]
    ```

### Retrive elements by positions or logicals

```{r}
positions <- grep("p", my_vector)
print(positions)
my_vector[positions] # [postion indices]
```

### Approach 1: grep

```{r}

```

### Approach 2: chatGPT

In R, you can filter a data frame based on some criterion using the `subset()` or `filter()` functions. Here are some examples:

Using `subset()` function:

```
# create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("John", "Jane", "Bob", "Alice"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 20, 35),
  Gender = c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female")
)

# filter the data frame to only include females
female_df <- subset(df, Gender == "Female")

# display the resulting data frame
female_df
```

Using `filter()` function:

```
# create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("John", "Jane", "Bob", "Alice"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 20, 35),
  Gender = c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female")
)

# filter the data frame to only include people over 25 years old
over_25_df <- filter(df, Age > 25)

# display the resulting data frame
over_25_df
```

Both `subset()` and `filter()` functions take a data frame as the first argument and a logical expression as the second argument. The logical expression is used to select the rows of the data frame that meet the specified criterion.
